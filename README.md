# The Hidden Island

## What's this?
- This is a WIP mod that will add a pair of twins (Winnie and Solary) to Stardew Valley.
- For Stardew Valley 1.6+ only.
- This mod is still on a very early stage.
- Winnie exists. She have a very basic schedule, can be talked to and can receive gifts.
- Solary will be added later. However, he's locked behind Winnie's events.
- This mod might break you game since I'm not very experienced in C# yet. Do back up your save file frequently to be safe.

## How can I meet them?
- Story purpose: After receiving a sword and successfully receive forest magic from the local wizard, you'll receive a mysterious letter. Read the letter to know how to meet them.
- Test purpose: Use CJB Item Spawner and search for Hidden Island. Use that item to teleport to the island.

## What to be expected in the future?
- Working NPCs with a storyline full of events and choices.
- (Hopefully) A lot of fun experiences.

## Bug report
- Feel free to report bugs to me!

## Known issues/bugs
- This specific type of surprise boxes are overpower/worthless: As long as alpha testers give me feedback/suggestions, I'll try to balance it.

# NPC Info (SPOILERS)

## Winnie
- __Age__: Adult / 25
- __Birthday__: Summer 28th
- __Residence__: An unnamed, hidden island accessible only through a warp totem. However, if you befriend her long enough, maybe you can help her move to East Scarp and rent out the other spare room at Tori's house?
- __Hobbies__: Reading (comic and romance), listening to stories, flower gardening, cooking food (she's really good at it!), eating food and spending on things.
- __Relationship__: She has a strained relationship with Solary - her younger twin brother. After she moved to East Scarp, she found herself getting along quite well with her roommates Tori and Nora, as well as sharing interests with Barron, Aideen and Plum... She's friendly with most of her neighbors and enjoys making friends, but for unknown reason, she developed a hyperfixation on Soot the first time they meet. She's also Xavi's childhood friend.
- __Personality__: She is sweet, kind and caring with her friends. For people that she struggles to understand, she tends to be passive-aggressive towards them. Most of her feelings can be read easily, as she never tries to hide it.
- __Likes__: Flowers, fried calamari, void food, milk coffee, fluffy animals, obsidian, iridium, purple, white, black.
- __Dislikes__: Spicy food, heat, bugs, alcohols.
- __Occupation__: Unemployed. Her dream job is being mage like her brother but she's unable to.
- __Special__: Her skin is cold as ice. Magic does not affect her in any kind. It nullifies itself when physically contacted with her. If she touch a mage, their mana will become unstable and if they use their magic with this state, it will be very risky. They will be back to normal when they stay away from her. Same for magic objects - the mana will be unstable and that magic object will not functional until she stop touching it. She cannot use magic or any magic items like trinkets, potions and totems.

### Solary
- __Age__: Adult / 25
- __Birthday__: Summer 28th
- __Residence__: He stays in his own tower most of the time and only comes back to the island on the weekends. After his sister moves to East Scarp, he'll live on the island instead and only go to somewhere else if it's about work or his sister request (for example, attending festivals).
- __Hobbies__: Reading, researching magic, brewing potion, worshipping Yoba and hoarding things.
- __Relationship__: His sister is the only family member he has, so he tries his best to protect her. He doesn't have anyone he can call a friend, but he does have a few individuals he can trust. Most of his colleagues respect him but also dislike him.
- __Personality__: He's quiet, patience and intelligent, but difficult to approach and always look like he's tired of everything. Unlike his sister, he doesn't feel it is necessary to maintain good relationships with others. He also hold a big grudge against the farmer.
- __Likes__: Spicy food, sweets, cactus, small reptiles, gold.
- __Dislikes__: Veggies, bitter food and drink, weird food, noises, potion overdose, cooking.
- __Occupation__: Currently working with the Ferngill Republic Ministry of Magic as a member of their Law Enforcement Unit.
- __Special__: He always put on special temperature adjust magic so he is rarely being affected by the weather. However, he dislikes winter because the link to light magic and nature magic is weaker during this time. He's a young mage so his mana pool is not as strong as experienced mages and usually have to relies on mana potions, that's why he put a lot of effort to research magic and improving his technique.
